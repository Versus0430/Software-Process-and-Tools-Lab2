# Software-Process-and-Tools-Lab2
This is the lab 2 of my Software-Process-and-Tools course.

What I have done: 
In this project, I mainly worked on designing a webpage, which is about a software that randomly generates an addition and subtraction question(number ranges form 0 to 100).Besides, this webpage is mainly designed for the pupils, so the whole style of the webpage might be a little cute~. As to the code, I mainly worked on Python and some css && HTML for the web front-end.

Among these files, the introduction below is to help you better read my project!
File Introduction:
1. "score": this is the whole source code file
2. "四轮迭代UML图": this is the directory contains the UML pictures for the four iterations of my prject
3. "实验1报告": this is the report of my project

Hopefully, this project will help you!
